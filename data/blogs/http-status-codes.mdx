### **What are the most common HTTP status codes?**

HTTP status codes are essential in understanding the response returned by a server after making an HTTP request. They provide the information about the status of the request and response from the server.

### ðŸŽ¯HTTP response codes are categorized into five groups:

Informational (100-199)

Success (200-299)

Redirection (300-399)

Client Error (400-499)

Server Error (500-599)

### ðŸŽ¯Here are some of the most common HTTP status codes:

- 200 OK: This status code indicates that the request was successful.
- 404 Not Found: This status code indicates that the requested resource could not be found on the server.
- 500 Internal Server Error: This status code indicates that there was an error on the server that prevented the request from being fulfilled.
- 401 Unauthorized: This status code indicates that the client is not authorized to access the requested resource.
- 403 Forbidden: This status code indicates that the client does not have permission to access the requested resource.

These codes are just a few examples of the many HTTP status codes that exist. The exact list of most common HTTP status codes can vary depending on the context and the specific application.
